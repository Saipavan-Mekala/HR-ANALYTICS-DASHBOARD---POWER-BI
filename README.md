# Project Title:
<B> HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD </B>

# Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze key factors contributing to employee attrition and provide data-driven insights to help reduce turnover. The goal is to help the organization improve employee performance and retention by identifying trends and addressing key concerns affecting workforce stability.

# Problem Statement:
This project focuses on developing an HR Analytics Dashboard to identify key factors driving attrition, such as experience, salary, job roles, and work environment. By leveraging data insights, the organization can implement effective strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.
# Data Source:
Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

# Tools Used:
Power BI

# Methodology:
1. <B> Data Preparation </B>: Imported raw data into Power BI Power Query and performed data cleaning and transformations to ensure accuracy.
2. <B>Data Integration </B>: Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.
3. <B> Data Modeling</B>: Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures and calculated columns for deeper insights.
5. <B>Dashboard Development </B>: Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers, charts, and graphs for effective visualization.
# Key Insights:
1. The highest attrition is among employees with under 5 years of experience, accounting for 68% of total attrition.
2. A significant portion of employees leaving (68%) cite low salaries (below $5,000) as a primary reason.
3. The Research & Development (R&D) department has the highest attrition rate.
4. Most employees leaving from R&D are freshers, indicating early-stage dissatisfaction.
5. 49% of employees express dissatisfaction with the work environment, contributing to retention challenges.
# Recommendations:
1. Increase salaries for employees earning below $5,000 to stay competitive.
2. Implement mentorship programs and clear career growth paths for freshers.
3. Offer flexible work options (remote/hybrid) to improve job satisfaction.
4. Conduct regular engagement surveys and take action on employee feedback.
5. Recognize and reward employees in Research & Development (R&D) to boost retention.
